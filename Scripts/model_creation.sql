CREATE MODEL `genai-assignment8.Remote_Model.IMDB`
REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `genai-assignment8.us.Vertex-AI-Connection-01`
OPTIONS(ENDPOINT = 'text-bison@002')

/*
Explanation:

CREATE MODEL: This keyword indicates that the query aims to create a new model.

genai-assignment8.Remote_Model.IMDB: This is the name of the model being created. It appears to be structured with a project ID (genai-assignment8), a dataset (Remote_Model), and a specific model within that dataset (IMDB).

REMOTE WITH CONNECTION: This clause specifies that the model will be hosted remotely, connected to a specific connection.

genai-assignment8.us.Vertex-AI-Connection-01: This is the name of the remote connection. It likely refers to a connection established to a Vertex AI service.

OPTIONS(ENDPOINT = 'text-bison@002'): This part defines an option for the model. The ENDPOINT option sets the specific endpoint for the model to use, which in this case is text-bison@002. This endpoint likely refers to a pre-trained language model or a specific machine learning service.

In summary:

This query creates a remote model named IMDB within the Remote_Model dataset. The model is connected to a Vertex AI service using the genai-assignment8.us.Vertex-AI-Connection-01 connection. The text-bison@002 endpoint is specified for the model to use.
